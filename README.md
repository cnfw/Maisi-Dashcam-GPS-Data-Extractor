# Maisi-Dashcam-GPS-Data-Extractor

This python script will convert a subtitles file generated by a Maisi Dashcam with a GPS module installed, into a more useful GPX file.
The script is incomplete, so please be patient as I work on it! The current state should work with subtitle files that haven't been modified in any way.

## Using the script

Follow the instructions for usage of the script. I will include sample data and sample output in the future.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* SRT File extracted from the Dashcam video file (this can be done using [YAMB](http://yamb.unite-video.com/) on Windows)

### Usage

```
maisigps.py <filename.srt>
```

### Output

The script will output a GPX file with the same name as your SRT file in the same directory the SRT file came from.

## Future Development Plans / TODO list

What I hope to add to the script in the future

* More parameters
   * Specify output location
   * Specify output format (other than GPX)
   * Option to embed speed data (included by default)
* Batch process an entire directory of SRT files
   * Option to join files together into one large GPX (due to the dashcam splitting video into 5 minute chunks)
